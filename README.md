# Eximo App

## About

The [Eximo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137916/eximo) game is a member of the Checkers family.

This app allows you to play against artificial intelligence or another human player on the same device.

## How to play

After starting a game, you can execute a move by simply clicking a piece of yours and then the destination spot. If you happen to click on a piece that cannot be moved at that time or an invalid destination spot, the process is reset. To make it more intuitive, the pieces that can be moved at each time of the game will be highlighted for a few moments when you fail to click one of those. After selecting the piece to be moved, the available destination spots will also be displayed highlighted.

The player turn is indicated right below the timer, both of which are integrated in the top navigation bar. When the game is over, the board is frozen, a victorious sound is played, and the winner's name appears in the bottom part of the screen.

When you start a singleplayer game, the intelligence of the opponent bot will depend on the game difficulty, which can be changed in the settings menu.

By default, each player starts with 16 pieces, as per the original game rules. However, this number can be customized for each player via settings menu, just like other preferences such as board theme and highlighting style.

Further information about the game rules can be easily accessed inside the app itself, either by clicking the "Settings" button from the main menu or the question mark icon in the top navigation bar during a match.
